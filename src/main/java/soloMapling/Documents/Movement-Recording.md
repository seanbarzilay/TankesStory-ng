# SoloMapling — Movement Recording & Pathfinding

How bots move through the world. SoloMapling supports three movement modes; this guide covers
the **recording workflow** (capturing real movement packets to replay) and the **pathfinding**
system (JGraphT directed graph + Dijkstra). Diagrams and walkthrough videos below.

> ⚙️ Implementation lives in `soloMapling/ArtificialPlayer/BotMovementSystem/`. There are 825
> pre-recorded movement files across many maps, plus three pathfinder variants
> (`pathFinderBeta`, `pathFinderAware`, `pathFinderAerial`) and a portal-based `NavigationSystem`.

*Map `080002001` — how a recorded path maps onto the map's footholds and connectors.*

*Map `010002030` — a more complex recorded path with multiple platforms and connectors.*

## Recording walkthroughs (video)

How to capture movement recordings on the server — building the main platform path first, then
stitching connectors between platforms.

### Main platform

▶️ **[Watch: Recording the main platform](https://github.com/MadaraGameDev/SoloMapling/blob/main/src/main/java/soloMapling/Documents/1%20SoloMapling%20assets/SoloMapling%20Technical%20Assets/SoloMapling%20-%20Recording%20Main%20Platform.mp4)** — recording the main platform traversal path.

### Connectors

▶️ **[Watch: Recording connector 1](https://github.com/MadaraGameDev/SoloMapling/blob/main/src/main/java/soloMapling/Documents/1%20SoloMapling%20assets/SoloMapling%20Technical%20Assets/SoloMapling%20-%20Recording%20connector%201.mp4)** — linking two platforms.

▶️ **[Watch: Recording connector 2](https://github.com/MadaraGameDev/SoloMapling/blob/main/src/main/java/soloMapling/Documents/1%20SoloMapling%20assets/SoloMapling%20Technical%20Assets/SoloMapling%20-%20Recording%20Connector%202.mp4)** — recording connector 2.
