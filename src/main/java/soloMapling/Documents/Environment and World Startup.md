# Environment and World Startup

Last updated: 2026-07-08 (v0.3 milestone: added wave 9 / town presence)
Covers: `soloMapling/Environment/` (4 files) — world initialization, the platform system, and the NPC/casino setup it drives. For the bot lifecycle inside each spawn, see `Artificial Player Framework Architecture.md`.

---

## 1. How startup is triggered

The environment cannot start until a real `Client` exists for bots to borrow. The chain:

```
first real player logs in
  -> BotClientHandler.createBotClient captures their Client
  -> 2s later that player is force-disconnected ("please relog")
  -> 1s later environmentLoadStartup() runs
```

You can also trigger it manually with `!env loadenv` (GM level 4).

## 2. The 9-wave startup

`EnvironmentManager.environmentLoadStartup()` populates the world in 9 waves. Each wave is a list of tasks submitted **in parallel**; the wave **blocks until all its tasks complete** (`runWave` -> `runPhase`), then the next wave starts. Every wave logs its elapsed time and how many bots it spawned; the run ends with a total (typically **~1,900 bots in roughly 10 seconds**; the tick architecture is scale-tested to 6,500+ via `!env trainscatter`).

| Wave | Name | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Essentials | Casino NPCs (Game Zone map), Tutorial Bot (Maple Island), 10 Henesys wanderers, Henesys FM region, FM entrance bots (5/5/5 across platforms m1/m2/m5) |
| 2 | FM buildout | Ludi FM, FM entrance batch, merchant bots on m1/m2/m5 (selling/buying/NX), Gachapon bots |
| 3 | Henesys population | JQ bots (Pet Park), wanderers (10 Main / 10 Market / 5 social), Henesys fillers; **then** SocialHotPotatoManager + ConversationManager start |
| 4 | Expand FM + Henesys Market | Perion FM, FM entrance batch, second merchant batch, Market fillers |
| 5 | Henesys sub-areas | Elnath FM, wanderers (10/10/10/4), Park / Potion Shop / Game Zone fillers, Game Zone host bots |
| 6 | Specialty | Blackjack tables, Drop Game Bot + Drop Game spectators (Potion Shop), Pet Park social bots, random filler -> scroll bot conversions |
| 7 | Late arrivals | OPQ lobby bots, final merchant batch |
| 8 | Training bots | ~1,240 roaming grinders: job-coherent cohorts at town spawn portals (Lith Harbour, Henesys, Kerning, Perion, Ellinia, Sleepywood, Orbis, Ludibrium, El Nath) and deep hubs (Ant Tunnel Park, Path of Time, Sharp Cliff I), plus 45 beginner sword grinders |
| 9 | Town presence (v0.3) | Ambient population for all 7 towns (`BotTownSystem`): one task per town spawns anchor-weighted stationed SocialBot cohorts + roaming TownWandererBots, headcounts fixed in `TownPresence.yaml`. Runs after wave 8 so the town nav graphs are already baked by the grinders spawned there; also re-runnable live via `!env townpresence` |
| — | After waves | `BotDecorationQueue.start()` (deferred full decoration) + `BotEquipChecker.start()` (2-min naked-bot sweep) |

Notes:

- FM room population is fire-and-forget internally, so its bots may be attributed to a later wave's count in the logs.
- Prerequisite data (`EquipMetadataCache`, `DesirableEquipList`) is **not** loaded here — it loads during `Server.init()` with the rest of the WZ-derived data, guaranteed ready before any player can trigger startup.
- Spawn arrival animations (drop-down, turn-around) run on virtual threads per bot, so wave duration reflects actual spawn work, not choreography (see the framework doc, §2).

## 3. Platform system

Bots must stand on valid footholds and not stack on top of each other. The platform system provides that:

- **`Platform`** — a named walkable segment of a map (e.g. `"m1"`, `"m4_social"`) with min/max X bounds and Y data; FLAT or SLOPED.
- **`PlatformParser`** — builds platforms by parsing **movement-recording CSV files** (`movementDataPackets/map<mapId>/<name>.csv`), extracting the (x, y) trail a recorded walk covered. Y variance over 50 px marks a platform SLOPED. Platforms are therefore authored by *recording a walk* across the desired area, not by editing data files.
- **`PlatformSpawner`** — picks spawn points on a platform: `findUnoccupiedPoint(s)` enforce a minimum spacing of 30 px between occupants with ~30% positional variance, falling back to gap-detection between existing occupants.

`EnvironmentManager` composes these: `spawnBotsOnMapOnPlatform(count, mapId, platformName)` finds unoccupied points, creates bots there, and returns their IDs for `setAndStartBots(ids, type)`.

Matching introspection commands: `!env getplat`, `!env getallplatforms`, `!env getallmainplatforms`, `!env getcharsonplatform <plat>`, `!env platformshuffle <cid> <plat>`.

Tolerances used when deciding whether a character is "on" a platform: Y within 10 px, X within bounds +20 px.

## 4. NPC spawning & the casino

`NpcSpawner` (in `soloMapling/server/`) places any NPC at an arbitrary position at runtime — no WZ map edits needed.

Casino setup (Wave 1, Game Zone map 100000203):

- `CasinoChipConfig` defines chip item denominations, exchange rates, and the NPC IDs.
- The **Casino Chip Exchange NPC** (9201066) runs `scripts/npc/9000055.js`, which opens **shop 9999001** — buy/sell chips at equal prices for lossless meso<->chip exchange. The shop rows are seeded automatically by the Liquibase migration `src/main/resources/db/data/171-casino-shop-data.sql` (reference copy: `soloMapling/Casino/casino_chip_shop_setup.sql`).
- `WzXmlPatcher` patches WZ XML so the casino NPC data exists client-side.
- Dev commands: `!env spawncasinonpc` (at your feet), `!env spawncasinonpcs` (proper map), `!env spawnrpsnpc` (Rock-Paper-Scissors NPC 9000019).

## 5. Re-running / partial population

Every wave's spawn task has a standalone `!env` command (`spawnfmbots`, `spawnhenesysbots`, `spawnallfillers`, `spawnbjtables`, `spawnopqbots`, …) so any slice of the world can be populated or re-populated ad hoc without a full `loadenv`. Social systems are independently controllable via `starthotpotato` / `stophotpotato` / `startconvo` / `stopconvo`.

Caution: `loadenv` is not idempotent — running it twice doubles the population. There is no "despawn all" wave; use `!bot massmanualstop` + `!bot dc` ranges if needed.
